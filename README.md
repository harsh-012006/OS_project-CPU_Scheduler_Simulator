Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator

1.	Introduction:-

The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a software tool designed to analyze and compare different CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. CPU scheduling is a fundamental aspect of process management, determining the execution order of processes to optimize system performance.

This simulator provides a visual and statistical comparison of various scheduling algorithms, including:

•	FCFS (First Come First Serve)
•	SJF (Shortest Job First)
•	Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-preemptive)
•	Round Robin (RR)
•	Multi-Level Queue (MLQ)
•	Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

The primary goal of this project is to enhance understanding of CPU scheduling concepts and analyze the efficiency of different algorithms under various workloads.

2.	Objectives: -
The main objectives of this project are:
a.	To simulate different CPU scheduling algorithms with user-defined inputs.
b.	To provide real-time visualization of process execution and CPU time distribution. 
c.	To compare performance metrics such as turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and CPU utilization. 

d.	To analyze how different algorithms behave under varying workloads and system conditions.
e.	To enhance understanding of process scheduling in operating systems using an interactive approach 

3.	Technologies and Tools Used:-

The project is developed using Python and utilizes several libraries for different functionalities:
• Tinder / PyQt5: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
• Matplotlib : For visual representation of CPU scheduling behavior.
•  NumPy & Pandas: For data handling and statistical analysis.
•  time: To measure execution time for performance evaluation.
•  threading: For ensuring smooth GUI operations without blocking UI interactions.
4.	System Design and Implementation


Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI is designed for user-friendly experience and includes the following components:
•	Input Fields: Users enter process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.).
•	Dropdown Menu: To select the CPU scheduling algorithm.
•	Simulate Button: To start the simulation.
•	Result Panel: Displays turnaround time, waiting time, response time, and CPU utilization.
•	Visualization Panel: Shows the Gantt Chart of process execution.



       Algorithm Implementation 

     Each CPU scheduling algorithm follows a structured approach:
•	FCFS (First Come First Serve): Executes processes in the order they arrive.
•	SJF (Shortest Job First): Prioritizes the shortest execution time process.
•	Priority Scheduling: Executes processes based on priority values.
•	Round Robin (RR): Allocates CPU time to each process in a cyclic manner.
•	MLQ (Multi-Level Queue): Categorizes processes into different queues with specific scheduling policies.
•	MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue): Dynamically adjusts process priority based on execution history.

       Algorithm Visualization
The tool includes a real-time visualization module, where users can see:
•	How processes are allocated CPU time.
•	Execution order and context switching.
•	Completion and waiting times for each process.
•	Gantt chart representation of scheduling decisions.

 5. File Recovery Module
The tool includes a File Recovery Module that allows users to recover previously executed process schedules. It stores execution details and lets users retrieve historical scheduling data. The recovery process includes:
•	Listing all saved process scheduling results.
•	Allowing users to select a schedule for review.
•	Replaying the execution sequence and visualization.
•	Displaying a confirmation message upon successful recovery.

7. System Performance Monitoring Module
The tool compares CPU scheduling algorithms based on:
•	Turnaround Time: The total time taken for a process to complete after submission.
•	Waiting Time: The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.
•	CPU Utilization: The percentage of CPU time spent executing processes rather than being idle.
•	Response Time: The time taken for a process to get CPU access after arrival.
•	Throughput: The number of processes completed per unit time.
These metrics are displayed in tabular format and graphical representation for easy comparison.
